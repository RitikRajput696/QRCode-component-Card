## Overview
It took me 2 hours and 30  minutes roughly to compelte this because i have started coding recently in month of December 2021 and today is 12 February 2022. It was the first time i was doing this kind of challange so I really learned a lot from this project about replicating design and solving a problem when you get stuck somewhere and taking different aproaches when things donot work as you have planned.

## My process

- First I created the html structure then I started give the backgroung colors to all the divs so that i can see what is happening when I make changes.

- I open the refrence image in figma and measured all the dimension, It took a lot of time beacuse I was doing it for the first time.

- After that I started structuring them and in the end I gave the styling like margin, font-size, etc.

- Then I perform the most important ritual which is centering the div in body, 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I have leared the most hardest thing in css which is Centering a div. 
jokes aside , I have leaned how to find solution to a problem when you stuck somewhere and learned art of Googlig.
I have learned that you should be flexible with your thing and be ready to change your strategy.

### Continued development

While doing this project I realised that I still lack behind in a lot of areas. I was planning to make this using CSS grid modal but faced some problem and then switched to flexbox. I have also struggled in Centerig <div class = card> vertically but finally found the solution.

I think I still need to focus on basic things and strenthen Polish them.
